# Input
I improve the Profile Card component by adding and styling the name, occupation, and profile description of a user.

# Process
I used class components in React Native and organized the layout with `View` components. I used an `Image` component to show a user picture, and added `Text` components to display the name, job, and a short profile description. I created styles using `StyleSheet` and applied properties. The image container was downloaded from `https://icons8.com/`

# Output
The final Profile Card shows a nicely styled card with a profile image, name, job title, and a short bio. The card is centered and has a consistent blue theme with proper spacing and alignment. After finishing this part, I have a better understanding of how styling works in React Native and how to group components visually using layout and style rules.
