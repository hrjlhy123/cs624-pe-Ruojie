# Input
I improved the Profile Card project by displaying six user cards arranged in a 3-row, 2-column layout. Each card shows a user image, name, occupation, and profile description.

# Process
I continued using class components in React Native. I replaced the flat list-style rendering with a flex layout, grouping cards in rows of two. I used nested View components to create consistent rows and applied styling to center and space the cards evenly.

# Output
The final result shows six profile cards, neatly aligned in three rows of two cards each. Each card maintains a clean blue design with shadows, borders, and padding. This part helped me better understand manual layout structuring in React Native, especially how to control positioning using nested containers and flexbox.
